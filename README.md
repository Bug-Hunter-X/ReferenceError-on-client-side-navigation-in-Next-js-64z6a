# Next.js Client-Side Navigation ReferenceError

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when navigating between pages in a Next.js application.  The error arises from a reference error caused by accessing an undefined variable on the client side.

## The Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`nonExistentVariable`) that is not defined. This will lead to a runtime error when the `/about` page is navigated to. The error will occur on the client-side after the initial page load.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the variable is properly defined before being accessed. Proper error handling is also vital to prevent unexpected application behavior.
